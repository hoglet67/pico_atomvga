80 column mode has two sub modes: 
1) Normal text where foreground and background mode are taken from the colours defined above, 
   except for semigraphics characters which are coloured as normel.

2) Attribute mode where the colours are taken from an attribute array in memort immediately 
   following the character data (this has currently not been tested on the Dragon) 

Please also note that Orange is not supported in 80 column mode, Orange semigraphics will be
green instead.
